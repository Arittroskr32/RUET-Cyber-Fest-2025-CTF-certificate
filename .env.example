# CTFd Certificate Generator Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and update with your settings

# CTFd Server URL (must match your CTFd installation)
# This should be the full URL where CTFd is running
CTFD_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Certificate Generator Port (choose a different port from CTFd)
# CTFd typically runs on 8000, so use a different port like 5001
CERTIFICATE_PORT=5001

# Secret key for Flask session (CHANGE THIS IN PRODUCTION!)
# Generate with: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-production

# Hash salt for certificate verification (CHANGE THIS!)
# This ensures certificate hashes are unique to your CTF
HASH_SALT=integrated-hawkers-ctf-2025-change-this

# ====================================
# IMPORTANT SETUP NOTES:
# ====================================
# 1. Users MUST be logged into CTFd before accessing certificate generator
# 2. This service authenticates via CTFd session cookies (no passwords needed)
# 3. Both services should be on the same domain for cookie sharing
# 4. No changes to CTFd infrastructure required - this is standalone
# 5. Data is fetched automatically from CTFd API using session auth
# 6. Users can only customize their display name, all other data is from CTFd
